Final team project for Mobile Application Development
This project replicates a movie review app. 
This application allows for users to be created and authenticated using Googles Firebase authentication. 
This project also has a firebase database attached for the user to leave the review.
This application allows for the user to be created and sign in. Upon sign in the user will select from a list of options on thier account.
